## Quick Start.

### For End Users (Standalone Executable)

If you want to use the standalone executable without Python installation:

1. Build the executable using the build scripts (see [Distribution.md: Building from Source](Distribution.md#building-from-source)).
2. Extract the generated `UltraCaptureV3-Distribution.zip` file to your desired location.
3. Double-click `UltraCaptureV3.exe` to launch the application.

**See [Distribution.md](Distribution.md) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.**

### For Developers (Development Setup)

**First Time Setup:**
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

**Launch Application:**
```powershell
.\start.ps1
```

The application will launch with the Fallout-themed interface ready for CAPTCHA recognition.

**Features:**
- Drag-and-drop image upload or file browser selection.
- Real-time CAPTCHA prediction with inference timing.
- Four informative tabs: Home, About, Architecture, and Inference.
- Professional Fallout-themed interface with retro aesthetic.

**For detailed setup instructions, see [InstallationAndSetup.md](InstallationAndSetup.md).**

## Model Architecture.

The model is a custom-built Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that integrates multiple advanced concepts for maximum accuracy:

- **Stage 1: Feature Extraction**: Deep CNN with ResNet-style residual blocks enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for channel and spatial attention.
- **Stage 2: Sequence Modeling**: Bidirectional LSTM processes feature sequences, refined by Transformer Encoder for long-range dependencies.
- **Loss Function**: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for unsegmented sequence learning.

**Key Specifications:**
- Input Size: 64×256 pixels (RGB).
- Hidden Size: 512.
- Attention Heads: 8.
- Transformer Layers: 4.
- Charset: 62 characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z).
- Model Size: ~273MB (ONNX format).

## Dataset and Performance:

### Dataset:

The model was trained on the **Huge CAPTCHA Dataset** that's been made by the author, **Mridankan Mandal**, which has been made available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a large number of CAPTCHA images with alphanumeric characters, where the label for each image is its filename.

  * **Link**: [Huge CAPTCHA Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redzapdos123/huge-captcha-dataset)

### Performance Metrics:

The model achieves high accuracy on both the validation and unseen test sets.

| Metric             | Validation Set | Test Set |
| ------------------ | :------------: | :------: |
| Sequence Accuracy  |     86.4%      | 86.37%   |
| Character Accuracy |     95.1%      | 95.08%   |
